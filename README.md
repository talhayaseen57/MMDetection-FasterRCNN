# MMDetection-FasterRCNN

This repository contains an Jupyter Notebook (`MMDetection_FasterRCNN.ipynb`) for training a Faster R-CNN model on a KITTI tiny dataset using MMDetection.

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide to training a Faster R-CNN object detection model on the KITTI tiny dataset. The model is implemented using MMDetection, a state-of-the-art open-source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch.

## Notebook Structure

- `MMDetection_FasterRCNN.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for setting up the training pipeline, configuring the Faster R-CNN model, loading and preprocessing the dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- MMDetection
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com))

Make sure to install all the necessary dependencies before running the notebook.

## Dataset

The KITTI tiny dataset used in this notebook can be obtained from OpenMMLab: [KITTI Dataset](https://download.openmmlab.com/mmdetection/data/kitti_tiny.zip)
